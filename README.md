## Forecasting Asset Returns Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence: A Quant Journey

This repository contains the research and analysis presented by J. Francisco Salazar at the [1st Artificial Intelligence in Finance Conference (AIIFC)](https://home.tpq.io/aiifc/), focused on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to forecast asset returns.

## About the Research
This body of work delves into the robust application of quantitative methods in finance. The journey is illustrated through detailed a Jupyter Notebook that guide users from data acquisition to complex strategy backtesting, employing cutting-edge AI techniques for asset return forecasting.

Key Highlights:
- Data Exploration and Financial Time-Series Analysis
- Visualization of Financial Indicators
- Advanced Statistical Techniques
- Implementation of machine learning methods for unsupervised learning, like PCA, to isolate market return factors.
- Application of Machine Learning Models for Forecasting
- Algorithmic trading strategy backtesting using classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and a Voting Classifier.
- Strategy Backtesting and Performance Metrics
